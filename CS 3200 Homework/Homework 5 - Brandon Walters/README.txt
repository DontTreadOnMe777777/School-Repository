Howdy!

Quick notes on the different PowerMethod files:
PowerMethod: Vanilla
PowerMethodFIXED: Not fixed, just changed to output largest eigenvalue instead of largest eigenvector
PowerMethodForPartD: Power Method changed to output smallest eigenvalue, used for Q2 Part D only
PowerMethodFIXEDPartE: Same as FIXED but doesn't print as much, makes output of Part E easier to read
