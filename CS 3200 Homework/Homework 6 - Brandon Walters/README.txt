IMPORTANT NOTE! : When running HW6_Q2_Bunny and HW6_Q2_Galaxy there seems to be some kind of error
associated with the Q matrix that will stop the generation of the compressed image. To solve this,
please clear the workspace for the program before each run of the program! To clear the workspace, simply
right-click on the Workspace (which should be located on the right side of the MATLAB window) and then click on
"Clear Workspace"! Thanks!
